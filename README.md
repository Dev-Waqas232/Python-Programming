I am going to learn python and try to practice most of the programming fundamentals in the next month and get a good hang of how things work in python so i can easily shift my jounrey into backend development with python using its different frameworks i.e, FastAPI, Flask, Django Rest Framework and then eventually into llms and AI and machine learning stuff.

## Goals for this repo
